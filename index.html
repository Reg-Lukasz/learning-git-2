            <p class="verse">Come to decide that the things that I tried<br>
                Were in my life just to get high on<br>
                When I sit alone, come get a little known<br>
                But I need more than myself this time<br>
                Step from the road to the sea to the sky<br>
                And I do believe that we rely on<br>
                When I lay it on, come get to play it on<br>
                All my life to sacrifice</p>
            <p class="refrain">Hey, oh<br>
                Listen what I say, oh<br>
                I got your- Hey, oh<br>
                Now listen what I say, oh</p>
            <p class="verse">When will I know that I really can't go<br>
                To the well once more time to decide on<br>
                When it's killing me, when will I really see<br>
                All that I need to look inside?<br>
                Come to believe that I better not leave<br>
                Before I get my chance to ride<br>
                When it's killing me, what do I really need<br>
                All that I need to look inside?</p>
            <p class="refrain">Hey, oh<br>
                Listen what I say, oh<br>
                Come back and- Hey, oh<br>
                Look at what I say, oh</p>
            <p class="pre-chorus">The more I see, the less I know<br>
                The more I like to let it go<br>
                Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa</p>
            <p class="chorus">Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder<br>
                Where it's so white as snow<br>
                Privately divided by a world so undecided<br>
                And there's nowhere to go<br>
                In between the cover of another perfect wonder<br>
                And it's so white as snow<br>
                Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed<br>
                And there's nowhere to go<br>
                Ho!</p>
            <p class="verse">When to descend to amend for a friend<br>
                All the channels that have broken down<br>
                Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up<br>
                Just to hear you sing it out<br>
                Step from the road to the sea to the sky<br>
                And I do believe what we rely on<br>
                When I lay it on, come get to play it on<br>
                All my life to sacrifice</p>
            <p class="refrain">Hey, oh<br>

                Oh, yeah! Tell my love now<br>
